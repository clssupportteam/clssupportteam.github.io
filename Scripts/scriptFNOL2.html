         Let’s move onto administering the assets your [insert relationship] had. Sometimes to release assets and deal with the estate, a legal process known as Probate (or Confirmation in Scotland) is required. I will now do a quick check to help you understand if that is the likely case for you:
	  </p>
	  <ul style="font-weight: bold;">
	    <li>Did your [insert relationship] own property in their sole name?
	    <li>Did your [Insert relationship] have assets such as bank accounts, savings, investments or premium bonds worth £30k or over in their sole name?
	    <li>Did the deceased have any other high value assets you think could trigger a probate need?
	  </ul>

         From what you have told me it's unlikely probate will be needed, but should anyone ask for it you can always call back and I can help with further information. If I can take your email address I can send you a link to the Co-op Legal Services Executor Hub, which is a free guide containing lots of helpful support and guidance and can be a reminder of some of the items I have discussed. We have covered a lot of ground; do you have any questions or is there anything further I can help you with today?

         Probate is an order from the court to allow the executors, or next of kin if there is no will, the authority to deal with the full estate.

         To help you with this I can arrange an appointment with one of our Probate Consultants and they can talk to you about your situation and what we can do to help.
        </p>
        <p>
         The meeting with the consultant is without any obligation and they will go through everything with you so you can fully understand what Probate is and what your choices are to administer the estate. They will provide you with a bespoke fixed fee quotation depending on the size and complexity of the estate.
        </p>
        <p>
         This will help you to make an informed choice about how you would wish to proceed. Would you like me to arrange that for you?

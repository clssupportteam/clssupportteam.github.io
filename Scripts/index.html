            <p style="color:grey;"><i>Note - Tailor advice around whether they have registered death yet or not.</i></p>
            <p>"The Tell Us Once Service notifies all government departments (such as DWP, DVLA, Passport, Benefits, Council Tax, HMRC and local Council for Council Tax). We recommend you use this service if you haven’t done so already as it will save you making multiple phone calls."</p>

            <b>Car insurance and Tax</b>

            <p style="color:grey;"><i>Note - Any unused car tax will be refunded</i></p>
            <p style="color:dodgerblue;">If you are intending to drive the vehicle, you will need to insure and tax the vehicle in your name. You may also want to consider SORNing the vehicle until any decision is made on what to do with it.</p>
            <p style="color:grey;font-style:italic;">Note - If selling, the NOK/Exec can do this and send V5 paperwork to the DVLA Sensitive Case work team, with a copy of the death certificate to process change of ownership.</p>

Tell Us Once does notify the local council, but it could take several weeks to affect the payments, so you can always contact the local authority directly either online or by phone to get payments reduced sooner.</p>
            <p style="color:dodgerblue;"><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">[ If No ]</span>: It's possible the property could be exempt from council tax for a short period. Please notify the local authority either online or by phone to discuss with them.</p>

So long as [you / the spouse/civil partner / the partner] are/is under state pension age, and depending on the deceased’s National Insurance contributions, you may be eligible for this payment. This payment is not means tested, and depending on circumstances can be as much as an initial lump sum of £3,500 plus a monthly payment over 18 months.</p>
            <p style="color:dodgerblue;">To ensure you receive the full amount due you MUST apply for it within 3 months of your [insert relationship] passing.</p>
            <p style="color:dodgerblue;">If you have a pen handy, I can give you details of how to check and apply for this - You can apply online via Gov.UK or by calling the bereavement services helpline on 0800 151 2012, or by post (details on UKGOV.com)</p>

            <p style="color:dodgerblue;">Some tax benefits are transferrable between spouses/civil partners – did the deceased have an ISA either a cash ISA or a Stocks and Shares ISA as part of their savings?</p>
            <p style="color:dodgerblue;"><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">[ If Yes ]</span>: You may want to investigate if you can transfer the ISA allowance. This would allow the saving to stay within its ‘ISA tax wrapper’ and move to [You / the spouse / the civil partner] tax free. To do this, we would suggest you notify the bank of your wish to utilise this option, ideally when notifying them to freeze all the sole accounts.</p>

          <div class="card" style="color:dodgerblue;">
            <p>Let’s move onto administering the assets your [insert relationship] had. Sometimes to release assets and deal with the estate, a legal process known as Probate (or Confirmation in Scotland) is required. I will now do a quick check to help you understand if that is the likely case for you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Did your [insert relationship] own property in their sole name?</li>
              <li>Did your [Insert relationship] have assets such as bank accounts, savings, investments or premium bonds worth £30k or over in their sole name?</li>
              <li>Did the deceased have any other high value assets you think could trigger a probate need?</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="card" style="background-color:#dddddd">
            <p style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">[If no to all questions]:</p>
            <p style="color:dodgerblue;">From what you have told me it's unlikely probate will be needed, but should anyone ask for it you can always call back and I can help with further information. If I can take your email address I can send you a link to the Co-op Legal Services Executor Hub, which is a free guide containing lots of helpful support and guidance and can be a reminder of some of the items I have discussed. We have covered a lot of ground; do you have any questions or is there anything further I can help you with today?</p>

            <p>It's likely that probate is going to be required to administer your [insert relationship’s] estate.</p>
            <p>Probate is an order from the court to allow the executors, or next of kin if there is no will, the authority to deal with the full estate.</p>
            <p>To help you with this I can arrange an appointment with one of our Probate Consultants and they can talk to you about your situation and what we can do to help.</p>
            <p>The meeting with the consultant is without any obligation and they will go through everything with you so you can fully understand what Probate is and what your choices are to administer the estate. They will provide you with a bespoke fixed fee quotation depending on the size and complexity of the estate.</p>
            <p>This will help you to make an informed choice about how you would wish to proceed. Would you like me to arrange that for you?</p>

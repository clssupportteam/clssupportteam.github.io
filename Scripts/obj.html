            If the Client advises they are not the Exec
          </h3>
          <hr>
          <p id="pItal">"Ok what I will do is send the hub link to you, for you to share with the the decision maker.
            However the Executor will need to call back (please leave full booking notes with estate information if
            this
            meeting is owned). Information needs to be reiterated on 2nd call with the decision maker."

          <p id="pItal">"That’s great, are you fully aware of what your responsibilities are as the Exec or
            Administrator,
            I can arrange for someone to call you to help you understand what is involved and the cost of Probate so
            that
            you understand your options."</p>

          <p id="pItal">"Not in all circumstances, if they are not named as the Exec and are only holding the Will,
            ultimately its up to the Exec how they administer the estate, what I can do is arrange a call with one of
            the
            specialists who can talk you through your options, so you know what to expect and provide you with a fixed
            fee

          </h3>
          <hr>
          <p id="pItal">"Is the Solicitor named as the exec or co exec?. The reason I ask is if you have not yet
            instructed
            them we can arrange a meeting with one of our consultants so that you can do a comparison with service and
            fee
            structure, however the Solicitor would have to agree to stepping down if they are the named exec."</p>

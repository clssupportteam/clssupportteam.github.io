          <p>My name is ……. and I’m calling from the <b style="color:#008B02;">Central Co-op Support Team.</b></p>
          <p>As you’re arranging a funeral with us <b>{for deceased name}</b> I want to let you know about some support
            that is included as part of the funeral arrangement to help you deal with some practical matters. First, I’d
            like to offer you my condolences.</p>
          <p><b>Is now an ok time to speak?</b></p>

        <div class="card">
          <p><b style="color:#008B02;">Central Co-op</b> has lots of advice and support to help people going through bereavement. We have
            information to access support groups and lots of useful articles that could be helpful, which I can send on
            email.</p>
          <p>There’s also support from <b>Co-op Legal Services</b>, there are two things they can help with. One is an
            online service where you’re asked a few questions about <deceased name’s> circumstances that then produces a
              checklist of all the legal things you might need to do. This is free to use, I can send this in the same
              email. </p>
          <p><b>Would you like me to do this?</b></p>
          <hr>
          <p><b>[ If Yes ]</b>- OK, can I confirm/take your email address please?</p>
          <p><b>[ If No ]</b>- OK, problem</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="card">
          <p>The second thing Co-op Legal Services can help with is checking if you need <b>probate.</b>I can find this
            out quickly with just a couple of questions if this that’s ok?</p>

                  the
                  will. I can provide you the email of support I mentioned earlier, and if you pass this on to the
                  executor, they will be able to request a call back from CLS when it is convenient for them. [Refer to
